 * An implementation of one-point crossover which results in two child solutions.

 * Child solutions will each have {@code index} bits from one parent and {@code solution.length - index}
 * bits from the other.
 *
 * The crossover is performed with a given probability - if no crossover occurs, the parents will be returned.
